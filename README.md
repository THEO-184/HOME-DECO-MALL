# SHOPPING-SITE
I made this  static shopping site with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.....no backend

The images used in this project was hosted on contenful.com. hence images are loaded from the inetrnet
If images are not loading, uncomment the async await function of the product.json in the JS file to load images locally.
if  Images still persist to load,Open the file with live server.This should solve all image loading problems
